# Week 4

# Hints:

# While true run forever
while True:
    # Use break to stop the loop!
    break

word = "banana"
i = 0

# While loop that counts up i till length of word - 1
while i < len(word):
    i += 1

# For loop (Starting Position, Ending Position, Step size)
for j in range(0, 10, 1):
    break

# Iterates through each letter of "banana"
for letter in word:
    print(letter)

# For loop (Start from 0, end at word length)
for i in range(0, len(word)):
    print(word[i])
